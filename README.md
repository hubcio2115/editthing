# Editthing

## What?

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

This is a Next.js project we've been tasked to do for our University curriculum. This'll be a web app that will act as a middle man between video editor freelancers and youtubers.

The app'll allow video editors to create a video post suggestion which they'll send for the owners of the channel to review. They'll be able to file changes, decline or approve the final work resulting in a succesfull video upload to the channel.

## Why?
This is a problem we've thought'd be perfect for a small project like this. It has some problems to solve but the list is not so long that we won't be able to finish it in a couple of months.
